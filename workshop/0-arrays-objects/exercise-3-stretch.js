// Exercise 3
// -------------------
// In the very first exercise, you logged a top-10 list of foods:

let mostPopularFood = [
  'bean burritos',
  'poke bowl',
  'chicken sliders',
  'pork baby back ribs',
  'chicken burritos',
  'chicken sandwich',
  'cauliflower rice bowl',
  'chicken and waffle sliders',
  'parmesan chicken',
  'buffalo-flavored cauliflower',
];

// Let's log them again, but this time with a proper "count-down". We should
// Start at #10, and go down to #1.
// There should be a **1 second delay** between each console.log. It should
// take 10 seconds to count from the 10th-best food to the 1st.
//
// After all the foods have been logged, the program should end.
//
// HINT: You'll need to use `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.
